<article><p> What's up? This is my writing a paragrph trying to describe how much I'm looking forward to building a web page. Yeah, I know it sounds exciting that's why I'm writing this right?</p>
         <p> Welp, as I said, I'm looking forward to learn how to build a webpage because I would like to do something other than playing and surf on the web when I'm using a computer. This one will be pretty basic because I don't want to amaze you yet with my web development skills, but I guess that througout I'll have to show you what I'm made of :P</p>
